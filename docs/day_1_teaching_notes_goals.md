# Session 1: Goals (teaching notes)

## Literature reviews in IS

- Be prepared to illustrate the concept matrix
- Mention that W&W offered more suggestions, but those are the most prominent ones

## Goals

{: .info }
> **Task**
> 
> Ask students whether anyone has a typical research question that fits to one of the four categories (write on the whiteboard)

- Testing: How effective are chatbot interventions for behavioral outcomes?
- Describing. What are the methods and contexts considered by TAM-research?
- Explaining: Why is attentional control inefficient in context X?
- Understanding: How do current research designs restrict our understanding of attention control theory?

<!-- understanding: may also cover "theory landscaping" (Okoli2012) -->

Predicting of Gregor 2006: relevant? something missing? 

### Paré 2015: reading

PDF in VC - 25 min, take notes

- What is your review type?
- Summarize the key characteristics
- For which review type would grey literature be relevant? Which review type is the most/least structured?
- If you were a journal editor/PhD student, which type would you prefer? (-> connect to frequency table: theoretical reviews are often pursued)

<!-- **TODO: mention SkinnerNelsonChin2022a and the correlation approach** -->

{: .info }
> **Exercise**
> 
> Classification exercise (rotating papers to the next student every 5 min, colleting the batch at the end and moving it to the beginning of the line once)

**Before**

- Discuss reading strategy (skim headings/figures etc)
- Ask students to take notes: which parts (figures/statements) led to your decisions?
- Set a timer to 5 min

- Application: classify example papers - print one version of each type, highlight particular pages/figures/goals, everyone selects one, after 3 minutes, we switch (prepare a table to fill out)
-> maybe even include 1-2 papers that are not reviews?

### Classification results

Take note of the central contributions (e.g., a figure / short summary)

Discuss results in groups of goals (testing - explaining, understanding, describing)
Ask students about the differences between types in the groups (what are the key characteristics you noticed?)

- Otte-Trojel2016: Realist review
- King2006b: Meta-analysis
- Melville2004: Theoretical
- Kitsiou2017: Umbrella
- Belanger2011: Critical - highlight that privacy is a multilevel construct but rarely studied as such
- Petter2008: Qualitative systematic
- Powell2004: Scoping
- Shim2002: Narrative
- Seuring2013: Descriptive

Possible additions:
- Zhao2014: Scoping
- Carillo2006: Theoretical (integrative) 

Any item that you would use as an inspiration (for your proposal)?

### Dimensions (Cooper's taxonomy)

- Mention my first project - classifying hundreds of papers / review types
- Dimensions, including knowledge building activities

- Outlook: 40+ methods/types. Anticipate: key question: how many types do we need (really distinct?) - anticipating Wagner et al. 2021.

### Central aspect: Internal coherence

What would be most coherent with your review type?
What would be the most incoherent combination?

### Internal coherence

- Requirement for the review protocol - need to study methods papers carefully, identify the characteristics, and justify your choices.

### What can we publish from a review project

Highlight that open science is just getting started in the area of literature reviews

End of first session: take notes on your ideas and how to introduce your topic, take notes on questions you would need to research

## Review protocols: Their purposes

- Purpose of a protocol (registries like PROSPERO, feedback, show examples)

A review protocol is a formal document that outlines the plan of a review project. It is the foundation of the entire review process
It forces to think through the different stages of the process at the beginning of the project and any associated challenges or issues
Having a detailed protocol ensures that all methodological decisions are carefully considered and justified, enhancing the trustworthiness of the results and conclusions
It also protects the authors against “scope creep”
Tendency of researchers to expand the work required without due consideration of the costs, schedule, etc.
Last, its publication ensures other researchers are aware that the review is being undertaken, minimizing the amount of time and resources wasted on duplicate reviews
