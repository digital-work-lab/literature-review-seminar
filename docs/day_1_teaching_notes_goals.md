# Session 1: Goals (teaching notes)

## Literature reviews in IS

- Be prepared to illustrate the concept matrix
- Mention that W&W offered more suggestions, but those are the most prominent ones

## Goals

{: .info }
> **Task**
> 
> Ask students whether anyone has a typical research question that fits to one of the four categories (write on the whiteboard)

- Testing: How effective are chatbot interventions for behavioral outcomes?
- Describing. What are the methods and contexts considered by TAM-research?
- Explaining: Why is attentional control inefficient in context X?
- Understanding: How do current research designs restrict our understanding of attention control theory?

<!-- 
- Understanding: may also cover "theory landscaping" (Okoli2012)
- Predicting of Gregor 2006: relevant? something missing? 
-->

### Paré 2015: reading

PDF in VC - 25 min, take notes

**Optional questions**:

- What is your review type?
- Summarize the key characteristics
- For which review type would grey literature be relevant? Which review type is the most/least structured?
- If you were a journal editor/PhD student, which type would you prefer? (-> connect to frequency table: theoretical reviews are often pursued)

<!-- **TODO: mention SkinnerNelsonChin2022a and the correlation approach** -->

{: .info }
> **Before**
> 
> - Discuss reading strategy (skim headings/figures etc)
> - Ask students to take notes: which parts (figures/statements) led to your decisions?
> - Ask students to Fill out the table.
> 
> **Exercise**
> 
> - Rotate papers to the next student every 5 min (**set timer**), colleting the batch at the end and moving it to the beginning of the line
> - Students: Classification exercise with [classification exercise sheet](../assets/classification-exercise.pdf)
> 
> **Solution**:
> 
> Highlight particular pages/figures/goals

Maybe even include 1-2 papers that are not reviews?

### Classification results

Take note of the central contributions (e.g., a figure / short summary)

Discuss results in groups of goals (testing - explaining, understanding, describing)
Ask students about the differences between types in the groups (what are the key characteristics you noticed?)

Describing:

- Shim2002: Narrative
- Seuring2013: Descriptive

Understanding:

- Powell2004: Scoping
- Belanger2011: Critical - highlight that privacy is a multilevel construct but rarely studied as such

Explaining:

- Melville2004: Theoretical
- Otte-Trojel2016: Realist review

Testing:

- King2006b: Meta-analysis
- Kitsiou2017: Umbrella
- Petter2008: Qualitative systematic

Possible additions:
- Zhao2014: Scoping
- Carillo2006: Theoretical (integrative) 

Any item that you would use as an inspiration (for your proposal)?

### Dimensions (Cooper's taxonomy)

- Mention my first project - classifying hundreds of papers / review types
- Dimensions, including knowledge building activities

- Outlook: 40+ methods/types. Anticipate: key question: how many types do we need (really distinct?) - anticipating Wagner et al. 2021.

### Central aspect: Internal coherence

What would be most coherent with your review type?
What would be the most incoherent combination?

### Internal coherence

- Requirement for the review protocol - need to study methods papers carefully, identify the characteristics, and justify your choices.

<div class="page-break"></div>

### What can we publish from a review project

Highlight that open science is just getting started in the area of literature reviews

End of first session: take notes on your ideas and how to introduce your topic, take notes on questions you would need to research

## Review protocols: Their purposes

Purpose of a protocol (registries like PROSPERO, feedback, show examples)

- A review protocol is a **formal document that outlines the plan** for a review project.
- It serves as the foundation for the entire review process.
- It prompts researchers to **consider all stages and potential challenges early in the project**.
- A detailed protocol ensures **methodological decisions are well-justified**, increasing the trustworthiness of findings.
- It helps prevent **“scope creep”** — the uncontrolled expansion of a project's scope.
- Publishing the protocol informs others about the ongoing review, reducing duplication of effort and resource waste.
