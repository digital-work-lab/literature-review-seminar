# Session 2: Tools (teaching notes)

Start with a question on students' current thoughts about tool selection in their review protocol.

Warm-up: have you worked with research software, what should the ideal literature review tools offer?

<!-- Video: Covidence / HubMEta 

## Self-managed approach: Tools

mention asreview / the spiral model:

-->

## Colrev

- OpenSource, extensible, validated, cost-efficient (open research software, e.g., R/Tidyverse, Machine Learning in Python, Visualization)
- Code environment (low-code)

<!-- 
Highlight that literature review data may be different from typical "reproducible research approaches". Why?
-> Explain the different properties (LRDM), Git
-->

Explicitly show the colrev status

Show the data (that is what CoLRev relies on)

Invite students to contribute to CoLRev (documentation, testing, etc.)

## LLMs, current challenges, and promises

How would you use genAI-tools in a literature review?

- Follow-up: any application areas for genAI (beyond LLMs) - image/audio/video? - e.g., Googles NotebookLM

- LLM like ChatGPT are seemingly easy to operate (simple interface), but generating useful output is surprisingly hard (a metaphorical Norman door)
- litmaps

## Which developments can be anticipated?

(not formally part of the main review steps)
 e.g., tabulating  - give examples 
 
effectively excluding over 90% of the information and only considering a few words of each PDF

-> we may even illustrate this with a whole paper and the title highlighted for screening

**Philosophical questions**

- makes researchers obsolete
- danger that it reduces deep engagement with prior literature (opportunity to preserve that ability)

## Outlook

Create a reminder for the presentation session

## Feedback

- Ask students for issues that are good/should be improved
- Mention 5-star ratings, and ask for feedback in the final evaluations

## Thank you!

The nice thing about literature reviews is that there are many roads that may connect us (or colleagues)

- Deep engagement (AI/generative AI? - reading not part of the process?)
- How could ML/machines/generative AI facilitate a deeper understanding (instead of distancing reviewers from the literature)?

Wrap-up! Plans for submission (presentation?!?!)
