## Summary

The Literature Review Seminar is designed to equip participants with the knowledge and skills to conduct rigorous and impactful standalone literature reviews.
Through **two in-person sessions (TBA)**, we will explore the diversity of literature review methodologies, key process steps, and the qualities that make high-quality review papers stand out.
<!-- Beyond the seminar, participants have the opportunity to apply their learning by developing a review protocol (3 ECTS) or a full literature review (6 ECTS) on a topic of their choice, helping them build a strong foundation for their research projects. -->

Literature reviews play a crucial role in information systems research, serving as a foundation for theory development, empirical synthesis, and knowledge development.
Many influential theories, such as Media Synchronicity Theory, the IT Business Value Model, and CARE Theory, have emerged from well-executed review and theory development papers.
Similarly, meta-analyses, as a distinct form of review, allow researchers to systematically aggregate findings from multiple empirical studies, uncover biases, and provide evidence-based recommendations for both scholars and practitioners.
Despite their importance, doctoral students often face challenges in crafting high-quality literature reviews‚Äîsimplistic systematic reviews or Webster & Watson-style reviews are frequently rejected by top-tier journals due to a lack of clear contribution, fit, or methodological nuance.
This seminar aims to address these challenges by equipping participants with a comprehensive understanding of literature review types, methodological rigor, and the expectations of leading IS journals.
Drawing inspiration from Guy Par√©‚Äôs Literature Review Seminar‚Äîa well-established course at HEC Montr√©al and McGill University‚Äîthis seminar offers a structured approach to developing impactful review papers that contribute meaningfully to academic research.

Literature reviews are a central method in information systems research and enable diverse contributions to knowledge development. For example, influential theories such as Media Synchronicity Theory, the IT Business Value Model, and CARE Theory were published as review and theory development papers. At the same time, meta-analyses, as a special form of literature review, provide the opportunity to aggregate empirical evidence from multiple empirical studies, quantify biases, and derive evidence-based recommendations for practice.

Role of LR (especially for doctoral students), 
Challenges: simple "systematic review" or Webster & Watson are often rejected
Need for nuanced understanding of types of reviews, methodological rigor and fit, and the contributions expected from review and theory development papers at top IS-journals.
To familiarize with these elements, the seminar draws inspiration from Guy Par√©'s Literature Review Seminar, which is a regular course for Ph.D. students from HEC Monr√©al and McGill University.
 -->

The learning objectives of the seminar are to

- Understand the methodological pluralism within the genre of literature reviews,
- Plan, and adapt the process steps to the objectives of the review,
- Discuss the quality of literature reviews across various dimensions, and
- Select appropriate software for the implementation.

## Part 1: Goals and Types of Reviews

The first part focuses on the types and goals of literature reviews, emphasizing methodological pluralism and the diverse purposes that reviews serve in research.
It introduces different forms of literature reviews, such as standalone review papers, background sections in empirical studies, funding proposals, and Ph.D. theses, with a particular focus on standalone reviews as independent contributions to knowledge synthesis.
The session distinguishes review goals‚Äîdescribing, understanding, explaining, and theory testing (Rowe, 2014)‚Äîand aligns them with different review types as classified by Par√© et al. (2015).
These include narrative, scoping, systematic, meta-analytic, and hybrid reviews, each serving distinct research needs.
To differentiate review approaches, the seminar introduces Cooper‚Äôs (1988) taxonomy of review dimensions, such as focus, goals, organization, perspective, and audience, helping participants critically assess how reviews vary in their methodology and intended contribution.
The session encourages participants to engage with these distinctions through classification exercises, refining their understanding of how different review types align with specific research objectives.

## Part 2: Steps of the Review Process

The second part focuses on the steps of the literature review process, emphasizing key methodological choices at each stage.
It introduces different frameworks for structuring a review, including the hermeneutic approach (Boell & Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2014) and systematic guidelines (Okoli, 2015; Templier & Par√©, 2018).
The session outlines the generic steps of literature reviews, such as problem formulation, literature search, screening, quality assessment, data extraction, and data analysis, while highlighting that the sequence and nature of these steps vary depending on the review type.
Participants explore different search strategies, including database searches, citation searches, and snowballing, and engage with search evaluation metrics (e.g., recall, precision).
The seminar also covers screening protocols, inter-rater reliability, and reporting guidelines like PRISMA, providing a structured approach to selecting relevant literature.
Finally, data analysis techniques, ranging from quantitative meta-analyses to qualitative coding approaches like the Gioia method, are introduced to help synthesize findings.
Through interactive exercises, participants critically evaluate search strategies and data extraction methods, refining their ability to conduct systematic and transparent literature reviews.

## Part 3: Qualities of Literature Reviews

The third part explores the qualities of high-impact literature reviews, emphasizing key dimensions of quality and their relevance to different review types.
The session begins with a warm-up exercise where participants identify essential factors for publishing in top-tier journals.
Through exemplar studies and review panels, participants analyze and evaluate review papers, identifying strengths and weaknesses.
Drawing on empirical findings from Wagner et al. (2021), the seminar highlights that methodological transparency and developing a research agenda significantly enhance a review‚Äôs scientific impact, while theoretical contributions remain difficult to measure systematically.
The distinction between systematicity (sound execution) and transparency (explicit reporting) (Par√© et al., 2016) is introduced alongside established reporting standards, such as the PRISMA checklist and Templier & Par√©'s (2018) IS-specific guidelines.
The session concludes with strategies for formulating a compelling research agenda, emphasizing how well-positioned, transparent, and forward-looking reviews contribute to knowledge development.

## Part 4: Tools Supporting the Conduct of Literature Reviews

The fourth part explores different tooling approaches for literature reviews, comparing self-managed setups (reference managers, Excel, specialized tools), platform-based solutions (Covidence, LitStudy, BUHOS), and open-synthesis platforms like CoLRev, which emphasize transparency and extensibility.
A live demo of CoLRev introduces its role in automating key review steps. The session also examines the potential and limitations of AI and generative AI (LLMs) in literature reviews, highlighting their usefulness in query formulation and screening while cautioning against hallucinations and inconsistent recall.
Discussions address how AI may reshape descriptive reviews while theory-building reviews remain human-driven.
The seminar concludes with guidance on assembling an effective toolkit, balancing flexibility, collaboration, and tool compatibility, and encouraging open and AI-enhanced synthesis approaches.
