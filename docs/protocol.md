> We do not expect you to complete the whole literature review, including the search, screen, data extraction, and analysis.
> Instead, the review protocol should demonstrate that your plans for each step are feasible and promising.
> To this end, it can be helpful to run the search, and to pilot-test the screen, data extraction and analysis with a few papers.

Prior work must be cited appropriately. We run a plagiarism check for all protocols.
