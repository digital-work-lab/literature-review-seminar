# Review Protocol

The review protocol and presentation will be weighted as follows in the overall grade: 70% for the review protocol and 30% for the presentation.

## Grading Criteria

The review protocol will be evaluated with the following criteria, closely aligned with the expectations discussed during in-person sessions and modeled after standards for review protocols submitted to conferences:

1. Fit

- Alignment between the topic, research objectives, review type, and methodological choices.
- Logical consistency throughout the sections of the protocol, ensuring that these elements are aligned with each other.

2. Transparency and Systematicity

- Clarity and completeness in the reporting of methods, including search strategy, screening criteria, data extraction, and synthesis procedures.
- Demonstration of rigor in methodological choices, in line with the review type.

3. Grounding in Prior Work

- Degree to which relevant theories, related reviews, and prior research are integrated.
- Justification for the review's rationale based on gaps or opportunities identified in the literature.

4. Feasibility

- Feasibility of completing the review project, given the scope of the review and reasonable resources.
- Evidence of pilot testing for search, screening, data extraction, and analysis to demonstrate the feasibility and the anticipated effort required to implement the methods.

5. Contribution and Relevance

- Potential to contribute meaningfully to academic research and/or practical applications.
- Clarity in articulatating the expected implications for the research field or areas of practice.

> We do not expect you to complete the whole literature review, including the search, screen, data extraction, and analysis.
> Instead, the review protocol should demonstrate that your plans for each step are feasible and promising.
> To this end, it can be helpful to run the search, and to pilot-test the screen, data extraction and analysis with a few papers.

Prior work must be cited appropriately. We run a plagiarism check for all protocols.
