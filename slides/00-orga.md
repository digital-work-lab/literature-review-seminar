# Prior knowledge of literature reviews, topics, and expectations

- What is your topic and research question for this seminar?
- What are your expectations for the seminar?
- Did you work on a literature review before?

---

# Your instructor: Prof. Dr. Gerit Wagner

Sustained **fascination** for literature reviews for 10+ years:

- 2014-2018: **Dissertation** on the scientific impact of literature reviews
- 2020-2022: Postdoctoral fellowship at HEC Montr√©al (Canada):

    - Worked with **Guy Par√©**, Ph.D., a frequent co-author and mentor, who served as a Senior Editor for Literature Reviews at JAIS
    - Served as a TA for the **literature review seminar** for Ph.D. students at five universities in Montr√©al
 
- 2022-2024: Professor of Information Systems at Otto-Friedrich-Universit√§t Bamberg

    - Started offering the **Literature Review Seminar**

- I have **published 20 papers related to literature reviews** (out of 30)
- I am the lead developer of **CoLRev**, a Python tool for literature reviews

# Why literature reviews are exciting (I)

Literature reviews are essential to respond to key trends:

- The rapid growing volume and variety of research output:

  - Over 2 million new papers per year
  - Over 600 guidelines for different research methods (see EQUATOR network)

- The need to demonstrate novelty of contributions and avoid reinventing the wheel
- The need to exercise critical judgment of prior research

<!-- TODO: show "scholarly sophistication", "to the best of our knowledge, this is new..."  -->

In the future, the ability to synthesize, organize, and critically assess prior research will become even more essential.

---

# Why literature reviews are exciting (II)

<!-- Literature reviews can make a variety of original contributions, ranging from  -->

Literature reviews can make theoretical contributions that could never be accomplished in an individual study.

Example: Media Synchronicity Theory (Dennis et al. 2006)

# Example: Review of the IS Success model (Petter et al. 2008)

# Why literature reviews are exciting (III)

![bg right:40% width:500px](../assets/hierarchy-of-evidence.png)

Meta-analyses and qualitative systematic reviews can be used to aggregate the empirical evidence across studies. They are at the top of the **hierarchy of evidence**. For **practitioners** and **policy makers**, meta-analyses can be an authoritative source of evidence:

 <!-- In healthcare, the hierarchy of evidence (on the right) is an integral part for *evidence-based practice*. There are similar examples in education (Hattie) -->

- The Cochrane Reviews (public health)
- The Campbell Collaboration (social policy, and criminal justice)
- Visible learning: A synthesis of over 800 meta-analyses relating to achievement (Hattie 2008)
<!-- - Time-series minimum-wage studies: a meta-analysis (Card and Krueger, 1995) 
- Job satisfaction and job performance: A meta-analysis (Iaffaldano and Muchinsky 1985)
-->

For **researchers**, meta-analyses and systematic reviews may indicate areas where empirical evidence is inconclusive.

Meta-analyses are able to address common errors that cannot be eliminated in empirical studies (e.g., measurement error or publication bias).


<!-- TODO : add the hierarchy of evidence (compare to IS where practitioners may often use practitioner journal/opinion papers) -->

# Why literature reviews are exciting (IV)

Literature reviews can have a profound impact (e.g., Vial 2019 is cited 2,000 times per year)

![center width:900px](../assets/vial_scholar.png)

---

# Why literature reviews are exciting (V)

There are many open challenges, such as 

  - Considering differences and synergies between disciplines in the design of methods and tools,
  - Design of LR software to manage data, AI, and collaboration,
  - Coping with massive input and addressing urgent demands (e.g., [COVID reviews](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review))

---

# Learning objectives

Acquire a broad understanding of

- the **goals** and types of literature reviews
- the **steps** of the process
- the **qualities** of a good review paper
- the **tools** available

# Outcome

- A **review protocol** applying this understanding and a short **presentation**
- [Criteria and resources](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/literature-review-seminar/docs/protocol.html) are available online
- Dates for submission and presentation: see [outline](../index.html#seminar-paper)
