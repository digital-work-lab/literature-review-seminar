# The Literature Review Seminar

## Goals and types of reviews

- Familiarize ourselves with different forms of reviews
- Dissociate goals and review types, along with their dimensions
- Appreciate the key elements of a review protocol

---

## Forms of literature reviews

Generally, literature reviews can take different forms, including

- a **standalone review paper**
- a **background section** of a primary study (e.g., related work, theoretical background, conceptual foundations)
- a mandatory **part of a funding proposal**
- a part of a **Ph.D. thesis**
- a **review protocol** (e.g., published in a conference or a registry)

Our focus is on **standalone reviews**: an "independent paper whose purpose is to synthesize the extant literature in a field without collection of empirical data" (Templier and Par√© 2018).

---

## Literature reviews in the management disciplines

- Early editorial by Webster and Watson (2002, MISQ, > 12.000 citations) with key suggestions

    - Rigorous search, including forward and backward searches
    - Concept matrix
    - Concept-centric writing instead of author-centric summaries

- Establishment of the Theory and Review Department at MISQ, and similar initiatives at JAIS, and JSIS
- Active discourse covering typological pluralism, systematicity, and transparency across top journals in Information Systems

## Goals of literature reviews

Building on Gregor (2006), Rowe (2014) distinguishes four goals of literature reviews:

- **Describing**: summarizing or classifying prior research on a phenomenon with little or no contribution to theory, i.e., without discussing underlying assumptions or rationales
- **Understanding**: making sense of prior literature and new phenomena, working towards a conceptual understanding, and often involving an in-depth, broad, or critical discussion before drawing synthetic conclusions
- **Explaining**: drawing on the literature to develop a conceptual framework, or theory with testable hypotheses, i.e., statements that explain real-world phenomena, and can be tested empirically
- **Theory testing**: extracting data from empirical studies to assess the aggregated evidence that has accumulated

<br>

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-help-6.svg) **Task**: Propose a research question that exemplifies each goal.

## The typology of Par√© et al. (2015)

- Par√© et al. (2015) published the established typology of literature reviews, covering 9 distinct types of reviews (plus hybrid reviews)
- The review types can be aligned with the goals of Rowe (2014), as indicated in the table (Templier and Par√© 2018)

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-magnifier-10.svg) **Task**: Familiarize yourself with the types of reviews in the typology of [Par√© et al. 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720614001116).

## Exercise: Reading circle

![image width:25px](../assets/iconmonstr-window-multiple-3d-alt-lined.svg) **Task**: Classify the selection of review papers according to the typology of Par√© et al. (2015):

- [B√©langer and Crossler (2011)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41409971)
- [King and He (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720606000528)
- [Kitsiou et al. (2017)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173160)
- [Melville et al. (2004)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25148636)
- [Otte-Trojel et al. (2016)](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/21/4/751/764620?login=true)
- [Petter et al. (2008)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ejis.2008.15)
- [Powell et al. (2004)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/968464.968467)
- [Seuring (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923612001741)
- [Shim et al. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923601001397)

> [Zhao and Zhu (2014)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-012-9350-4) and [Carillo and Beaudry (2006)](https://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol17/iss1/21/) may also be covered (depending on group size).

## Exercise: Select the review type

Form groups according to the goals with regard to theory (describing, understanding, explaining, testing).

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-pencil-15.svg) **Task**: Draft the research question, select a review type and explain why it fits.

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-idea-13.svg) **Discussion**: Share your draft and discuss whether there is a high fit.

---

## Summary

- Literature reviews serve different **goals**‚Äîdescribing, understanding, explaining, and theory testing.
- There are **multiple forms and types** of reviews, including background sections, review protocols, or standalone papers.
- We explored the **typology by Par√© et al. (2015)** and how different review types align with specific goals.
- Clearly defining the review goal and type is essential to ensure **internal coherence** with its key dimensions and steps.

---

## Possible next steps

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-note-23.svg) **Task**: Explore the literature related to your topic and identify 

1. **Related review papers** that should be mentioned in your review (protocol)
2. **A review paper that exemplifies your chosen review type**, which may serve as an inspiration for your work

Prepare to give an overview of the related review papers and explain what is particularly compelling in the exemplary review paper.

<!-- 
## Practice: First draft of a review protocol

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-note-23.svg) **Task**: Create a quick draft for your protocol, covering the following elements:

- Title and keywords
- Introduction in bullet points 
- Background (what contents you would cover)

 -->
<!-- - Discussion of your proposals -->
