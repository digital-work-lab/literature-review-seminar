# The Literature Review Seminar

## Steps of the process

- Understand the generic steps of the review process
- Appreciate the critical methodological choices in the search, screen, and analysis

---

## What are the generic steps of a literature review?

## Generic steps: Examples

![bg right:40% width:400px](../assets/Okoli2015.png)

![center width:350px](../assets/Boell2014-fig1.png)

- The hermeneutic framework of Boell and Cecez-Kecmanovic (2014) vs.
- The systematic guide of Okoli (2015)

<!-- 
Discuss how the models fit together / what the underlying differences are

- Reading activities: in the "data extraction"
hermeneutic vs. systematic traditions
inductive/emergent vs. deductive form of data analysis

Okoli: screen before search? (search: "reporting the search")

<!-- TODO : discuss the differences between review types -->

---

## Generic steps

Summary

- The **nature of steps varies**, including their labels, their characteristics, and how they are arranged
- The steps **depend on the review type**
- Some steps are more **generic**, while others are more **specific** and only apply to selected types of reviews

In the following, we focus on the steps summarized by Templier and Paré (2018):

1. Problem formulation
2. Literature search
3. Screening for inclusion
4. Quality assessment
5. Data extraction
6. Data analysis and interpretation

<!-- Remember: coherence -->

---

## Problem formulation

- Rationale for the review, including an overview of related review papers
- Gap-spotting or problematization (Alvesson and Sandberg 2011):

    - Gap-spotting is seen as (too) common, and may only signify a contribution if the authors can make a convincing argument that the gap is important
    - Problematization, as an approach that challenges existing theory and the underlying assumptions, can lead to more interesting and noteworthy contributions

- Research question or objectives

<!-- 

- methodological coherence objectives/type/methods
-> we have done that in the first session
-->

---

## Literature search: Foundations

- Search types: *Lookup* vs. *exploratory* vs. **systematic search** (Gusenbauer and Haddaway 2021)
- Search scope: time, journals, and academic vs. gray literature
- Search techniques (with associated search sources):

    - Database search (keyword-based)
    - Backward search, i.e., search reference sections to go back in time (aka. snowballing, pearl-growing)
    - Forward search, i.e., using citation indices to go forward in time
    - Table-of-content search (whole journals)
    - Sampling from prior review papers
    - Consulting with peers (e.g., through direct contact or mailing lists)

---

## Literature search: Citation searches

![center width:650px](../assets/forward-backward-searches.png)

---

## Literature search: The database search

- Most common search strategy in the management disciplines (58% according to Hiebl, 2023)
- Common databases: Web of Science, EBSCO Host, ABI Informs, AIS eLibrary, ACM Digital Library, IEEEXplore, etc. (Knackstedt and Winkelmann 2006, Hiebl 2023)
- Effective search strategies for database searches combine search terms with Boolean operators

![bg right:40% width:500px](../assets/search-query.png)

---

## Literature search: The "building-blocks" approach

- RQ: What factors do influence physicians’ acceptance of telemedicine?

![center width:400px](../assets/building-blocks.png)

Resulting search string: `(telemedicine OR telehealth OR ...) AND (physician OR doctor OR ...) AND (adoption OR acceptance OR resistance OR ...)`

Building blocks can be based on established frameworks like PICO (population-intervention-control-outcome)

<!--

-> Check the Ringeval search. Surprising: the search strategy was stated without any trial-and-error/iterations. Explain the linked-list format, explain the Concept-Synonym-group approach

## Exercise: Review a search strategy

Imagine you serve as a reviewer for a conference. You review a paper on algorithmic decision making, along with Table 2.

- Evaluate the proposed search strategy critically, taking into account the building-block approach. 
- Make a recommendation to accept, revise, or reject.

![bg right:50% width:500px](../assets/MahmudEtAl2022.png)

## Literature search: Strengths and shortcomings of database searches

Strengths:

- Relatively efficient (see Wagner et al. 2021, Appendix A3)
- Transparent and reproducible

Shortcomings:

- Keyword searches: rely on exact matches 
- Need to be familiar with the vocabulary (check keywords or taxonomies like [MeSH](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/?_gl=1*1v2wumx*_ga*MTAzMDkzMDY3OC4xNjg1OTY3ODEy*_ga_7147EPK006*MTY5ODMwNDkxNi4xMC4xLjE2OTgzMDQ5MjIuMC4wLjA.*_ga_P1FPTH9PL4*MTY5ODMwNDkxNi4xMC4xLjE2OTgzMDQ5MjIuMC4wLjA.) etc.)
- Assumption of controlled scientific vocabulary although disciplines like Information Systems have abandoned corresponding efforts decades ago (Weber 2003)

<!-- anecdote: sex vs. gender -->

## Literature search: Search metrics

The common objective is to identify all relevant papers. Literature searches retrieve documents:

<!-- 
- $TP$: True positives = *retrieved* by the search and *relevant*
- $FP$: False positives = *retrieved* by the search but *irrelevant*
- $FN$: False negatives = *not retrieved* by the search and *relevant* ❓
- $TN$: True negatives = *not retrieved* by the search but *irrelevant* ❓
 -->

![center width:650px](../assets/retrieval-matrix.png)

Three key metrics are particularly relevant in the context of literature searches (Cooper et al. 2018):

1. **Sensitivity** aka. recall: $TP / (TP + FN)$. *How many of the relevant papers do we find?* ❓
2. **Specificity**: $TN / (TN + FP)$. *How well does the search exclude irrelevant results?* ❓
3. **Precision**: $TP / (TP + FP)$. *How many of the search results are actually relevant?*

---

## Literature search: Assessing searches

- **Precision** is the only metric that can be measured in a typical literature review
- A **highly precise search strategy should be suspicious** because the search may not be comprehensive enough
- Based on the [SYNERGY](https://github.com/asreview/synergy-dataset) dataset, average precision is 2% - 4% in medicine, chemistry, and computer science

Would you expect more precise searches in disciplines like Information Systems, Management, or the Social Sciences? 

![bg right:35% width:450px](../assets/SYNERGY.png)

<!-- 
It is instructive to know these metrics
The key objective is to identify all relevant papers, but also to do that efficiently
A certain level of noise (precision) must be accepted
SYNERGY datasets: 
https://github.com/asreview/synergy-dataset
included = relevant
all records (retrieved) = True positives and False positives
on average: 4% or 2% when removing outliers
-> check absolute numbers: 
covering 1,000 papers to identify 20-40 relevant ones (search may be too narrow when the inclusion percentage is bigger)

-->

---

## Literature search: Application

- Draft a search strategy for your topic following the building-blocks approach.

![center width:1200px](../assets/concept-map.png)

- Does the building block approach provide a good fit with your context?

---

## Literature search: Outlook

Open challenge: 

- How can we iterate efficiently?
- How do we justify the decision to terminate a search?
- How can we use evidence to search effectively?
- How can we make progress without database providers?

![bg right:40% width:500px](../assets/jukan-tateisi-bJhT_8nbUA0-unsplash.jpg)

<!-- 
"We have waited too often that database provides improve search capabilities"!

-->

---

## Screen

- The screen is typically completed in two parts:

    - A pre-screen based on metadata (*"include if in doubt"*)
    - A screen based on full-text documents, resulting in the final sample

- The screen is often based on explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria

![bg right:50% width:500px](../assets/study-selection.png)

---

## Screening reliability

Screening tasks are often split among the review team to complete the process **more quickly**, and to ensure **reliable decisions**

Process:

1. Definition of criteria, training, and pilot test
2. Parallel-independent screen (partially or fully overlapping sample)
3. Independent screen of the remaining papers (if any)
4. Reconciliation: in case of disagreements, final decisions are made by selected team members (often more senior researchers)
5. Calculate inter-rater agreement (e.g., Cohen's Kappa) and report the process

<!-- 
-> illustrate "Percentage agreement, Agreement by chance" with an example on the blackboard
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa
-->
---

TODO : bring interpretations of kappa values, mention that higher kappa is difficult when the distribution is skewed

---

## Reading strategies

The reading activities can be organized strategically at two levels:

- The overall corpus level: In which order should papers be read or skimmed?

- The individual paper level: How should the different parts of a paper be read?

Assume you have 300 papers to cover, how would you organize the reading activities?

---

## Data analysis

Key differences with regard to data extraction and analysis:

- Focus on metadata vs content 
- Inductive vs deductive reasoning

![bg right:40% width:500px](../assets/deductive-inductive.png)

---

## Data analysis example: Metadata profiling (example)

![center width:700px](../assets/profiling.png)

<!-- cite Bandara !? on profiling? -->

---

## Data analysis example: Co-citation analysis

![center width:700px](../assets/scientometric.png)

---

## Data analysis example: VOS viewer

![center width:600px](../assets/vos_viewer.png)

- Example keyword analysis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dTWkNRxUtw
- Example bibliometric analysis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmLWjcsV4zQ

<!--
TBD: Illustrate differences between co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling?

Highlight the Web of Science data export format

-->

---

## Data analysis example: Inductive coding

Grounded theory is an inductive method commonly used in literature reviews (Wolfswinkel et al. 2013)

In the data analysis phase, the three coding techniques are central:

- **Open coding** generates higher-abstraction level type categories from sets of concepts/variables
- **Axial coding** develops categories and relates them to their possible sub-categories
- **Selective coding** integrates and refines the categories

---

## Data analysis: The Gioia data structure

The coding process and results are often illustrated in the *Gioia data structure*

![center width:550px](../assets/gioia-example.png)

---

## Data analysis: Example for inductive analysis


- Scope: Digital platforms for knowledge-intensive services, such as Upwork, Fiverr, or TopCoder
- Sample: 50 papers, mostly published in the Information Systems discipline
- Data: Text fragments and figures have been pre-selected: [access the worksheet](../teaching_notes/Inductive-coding-Worksheet.pdf)

- Objective: Analyze extant research and inductively develop a process model

---

TODO : present a clear Gioia structure as a result

---

## Data analysis example: Aggregating evidence (I)

**Vote counting** is one technique to aggregate the evidence from prior empirical studies

- Key variables are extracted and compiled in a list of master codes
- Effects between independent and dependent variables are coded:

    - *+1* for a positive significant effect
    - *0* for no-significant effects
    - *-1* for negative significant effects

<!-- 
Exampe: Lacity et al. (2011)

TODO : summarize vote counting and give an outlook on meta-analyses

- data extraction (reliability, ...)
- risk-of-bias (quality) assessment
- Vote counting example (meta-analysis)
 -->
---

## Example: Lacity et al. (2011)

Effects are aggregated and presented as follows:

![center width:650px](../assets/aggregating-evidence.png)

---

## Data analysis example: Aggregating evidence (II)

Strength of vote counting:

- Aggregates evidence from **quantitative and qualitative studies**

Shortcoming of vote counting:

- Risk of bias is not assessed
- Effect sizes are not determined

Meta-analysis techniques address these shortcomings.

<!-- - Hierarchy of evidence (medicine) -->

---

## Data analysis: Risk of bias assessment (I)

- Example: Ringeval et al. (2020): "Fitbit-Based Interventions for Healthy Lifestyle Outcomes: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"
- The [Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2)](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-08) covers seven **domains of bias** as illustrated in the table

![bg right:50% width:600px](../assets/risk-of-bias-table.png)

---

## Data analysis: Risk of bias assessment (II)

![center width:250px](../assets/risk-of-bias-summary.png)

---

## Data analysis: Data extraction

Research objective: "to assess the effects of Fitbit-based interventions, compared with nonwearable control groups, on healthy lifestyle outcomes." (Ringeval et al. 2020)

Data extraction (example): 

- Two randomized controlled trials: Thorndike et al. 2014, van Blarigan et al. 2019
- Extract the following findings (at follow-up):

![center width:1000px](../assets/coding-sheet.png)

---

## Data analysis: Forest plot of standardized mean differences

![center width:1000px](../assets/forest-plot.png)

---

## Discussion of the data analysis section

Create a quick draft for the data extraction and analysis section. 

- Would you follow an inductive or deductive approach (why)?
- What outcomes would you expect ideally?
