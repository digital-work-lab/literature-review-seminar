# The Literature Review Seminar

## Goals and types of reviews

- Familiarize ourselves with different forms of reviews
- Dissociate goals and review types, along with their dimensions
- Appreciate the key elements of a review protocol

---

## Forms of literature reviews

Generally, literature reviews can take different forms, including

- a **standalone review paper**
- a **background section** of a primary study (e.g., related work, theoretical background, conceptual foundations)
- a mandatory **part of a funding proposal**
- a part of a **Ph.D. thesis**
- a **review protocol** (e.g., published in a conference or a registry)

Our focus is on **standalone reviews**: an "independent paper whose purpose is to synthesize the extant literature in a field without collection of empirical data" (Templier and Par√© 2018).

---

## Literature reviews in information systems

- Early editorial by Webster and Watson (2002, MISQ, > 12.000 citations) with key suggestions

    - Rigorous search, including forward and backward searches
    - Concept matrix
    - Concept-centric writing instead of author-centric summaries

- Establishment of the Theory and Review Department at MISQ, and similar initiatives at JAIS, and JSIS
- Active discourse covering typological pluralism, systematicity, and transparency across top journals in Information Systems

## Goals of literature reviews

Building on Gregor (2006), Rowe (2014) distinguishes four goals of literature reviews:

- **Describing**: summarizing or classifying prior research on a phenomenon with little or no contribution to theory, i.e., without discussing underlying assumptions or rationales
- **Understanding**: making sense of prior literature and new phenomena, working towards a conceptual understanding, and often involving an in-depth, broad, or critical discussion before drawing synthetic conclusions
- **Explaining**: drawing on the literature to develop a conceptual framework, or theory with testable hypotheses, i.e., statements that explain real-world phenomena, and can be tested empirically
- **Theory testing**: extracting data from empirical studies to assess the aggregated evidence that has accumulated

<br>

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-help-6.svg) **Task**: Propose a research question that exemplifies each goal.

---

## The typology of Par√© et al. (2015)

- Par√© et al. (2015) published the established typology of literature reviews, covering 9 distinct types of reviews (plus hybrid reviews)
- The review types can be aligned with the goals of Rowe (2014), as indicated in the table (Templier and Par√© 2018)

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-magnifier-10.svg) **Task**: Familiarize yourself with the types of reviews in the typology of [Par√© et al. 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720614001116).

## Exercise: Select the review type

Form groups according to the goals with regard to theory (describing, understanding, explaining, testing).

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-pencil-15.svg) **Task**: Draft the research question, select a review type and explain why it fits.

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-idea-13.svg) **Discussion**: Share your draft and discuss whether there is a high fit.

## The RightReview tool

The [RightReview](https://rightreview.knowledgetranslation.net/) tool provides a survey of literature review dimensions to identify the right review type for your project.

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-speech-bubble-comments-thin.svg) **Task**: Complete the survey and check your results.

- Do you agree? Are there any dimensions that are unclear?

![bg right:40% width:450px](../assets/right-review-tool.png)

---

## What can we publish from a review project?

- Review protocol: [Open Science Foundation (OSF)](https://osf.io/), [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/), conference proceedings
- Search strategy: [searchRxiv](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/journal/searchrxiv)
- Options to publish standalone review papers:

    - Conference proceedings (e.g., ICIS track for literature reviews)
    - Specialized journals for literature reviews (e.g., International Journal of Management Reviews, Foundations and Trends¬Æ in [Information Systems, Entrepreneurship, Management, Marketing,...])
    - Journals with theory and review departments (e.g., Journal of the AIS)
    - Review special issues (e.g., Journal of Strategic Information Systems)
    - Regular submission to journals

- Review dataset: [OSF](https://osf.io/), [SYNERGY datasets](https://github.com/asreview/synergy-dataset)

---

## Review protocols: Their purposes

- Make concrete plans for a review project
- Pilot-test the feasibility and potential contribution
- Solicit feedback from peers
- Publish the protocol to signal your work (e.g., in a registry like PROSPERO or at OSF)

![bg right:40% width:450px](../assets/prospero.png)

--- 

## Review protocols: Conceptions

- A plan that is developed a priori and fixed. The protocol regulates researchers and requires them to follow an inflexible set of rules. Fixed protocols are more common in the health sciences and are often associated with theory-testing reviews like meta-analyses.
- A ‚Äúliving plan‚Äù. The protocol is a living document that is used as a work log that records how the review project has evolved over time. Researchers may deviate from their original plan. Protocol development is thus iterative.

---

## Review protocols: Structure and contents (I)

- Title (indicating that this is a review protocol)
- Plain or structured abstract (written at the end) and keywords (up to 5)
- Introduction section (WHAT and WHY)

    - Generativity statements
    - Brief introduction of the topic, phenomenon, and theory of interest
    - Rationale for the review
    - Review objectives (and research questions)
    - Scope of the review
    - Expected contributions of the review

- Background section (WHAT / if applicable)

    - Definition of key concepts/presentation of the framework to be used to organize the review, presentation of the theory at the center of the review, etc.

- Expected results:

    - Structure of the synthesis (first-level headings)
    - Proposed presentation of synthesis (e.g., in the form of a table or figure)

---

## Review protocols: Structure and contents (III)

---

## Until next session

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-note-23.svg) **Task**: Explore the literature related to your topic and identify 

1. **Related review papers** that should be mentioned in your review (protocol)
2. **A review paper that exemplifies your chosen review type**, which may serve as an inspiration for your work

Prepare to give an overview of the related review papers and explain what is particularly compelling in the exemplary review paper.

<!-- 
## Practice: First draft of a review protocol

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-note-23.svg) **Task**: Create a quick draft for your protocol, covering the following elements:

- Title and keywords
- Introduction in bullet points
