# The Literature Review Seminar

## Qualities

- Distinguish different quality dimensions for literature reviews
- Explain which qualities are essential for the different types of reviews

---

## Warm-up exercise

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-help-6.svg) **Question**: What are the exemplary review papers you selected? Why do you consider them to make a particularly compelling contribution?

## Warm-up exercise

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-pencil-15.svg) **Task** (10 min): Record your topic, research question, and the type of review.

## Warm-up exercise

![image](../assets/iconmonstr-help-6.svg) **Question**: If aiming for a top-tier journal, what key aspects would you focus on to produce a high-quality review paper?

## Studying the qualities of exemplars

Studying exemplary literature reviews and analyzing the qualities that make them compelling provides valuable insights into what constitutes a high-quality review.

## An empirical analysis

The study of Wagner et al. (2021)

- There is a plethora of commentaries, opinions, suggestions, and ideas on the characteristics of a high quality review 
- We brought together an international and interdisciplinary team to study the question empirically
- The research question: What are the main attributes that affect the scientific impact of IS review papers?
- The research model covers factors at three levels: the paper, the authors, and the journal

## Findings

![center width:1100px](../assets/lr-sciento-findings.png)

---

## Key insights

- Methodological **transparency** is associated with higher scientific impact across all types of reviews
- The development of a **research agenda** is associated with higher scientific impact (except for reviews aimed at theory testing, due to a lack of data)
- The effects vary between **review types**, providing empirical evidence to the notion of methodological and typological pluralism
- Differences in **theoretical contributions** are hard to measure (contributing to *explaining*, in itself, does not lead to a higher impact)

---

## Methodological transparency and systematicity

![center width:600px](../assets/pare2016-twin-concepts.png)

Par√© et al. (2016) sensitize us to the distinction between **systematicity** and **transparency**:
One refers to the *soundness of execution* and the other refers to the *explicitness of reporting*.

<!-- Pare2016/Templier2018 -->

---

## Reporting standards

- In Information Systems, Templier and Par√© (2018) provide an overview of recommended reporting items
- In the health sciences, the [PRISMA checklist](https://www.prisma-statement.org/prisma-2020-checklist) provides established guidelines for transparent reporting of literature reviews

---

## Theoretical contributions

- Quality of theoretical contributions is hard to measure
- There are high-level guidelines such as Leidner and Tona's (2021) *thought-gear model for theorizing*

![center width:450px](../assets/theorizing_leidner.png)

---

## Research agenda

- Schryen et al. (2020) state that a research agenda "refers to elaborating on how researchers should conduct future research to achieve meaningful progress and possibly suggesting specific research designs, empirical settings, or offering strategic recommendations"
- There are almost no recommendations on how to develop a research agenda
- It may be helpful to study exemplars, which may inspire your research agenda

## Summary

Literature reviews can be expected to be more impactful if they

- are positioned with regard to an **appropriate review type**
- are **more transparent** in explicating their methods
- make a compelling and innovative **theoretical or empirical contribution**
- provide more comprehensive **suggestions for future research**

TODO : discuss the coding of a paper according to PRISMA
Highlight that it is useful to do that for the review protocol/paper (check whether you can see the type of review from the methods, code it according to PRISMA)
